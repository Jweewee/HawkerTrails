review1:My go-to. It‚Äôs smooth and velvety, and the ingredients are well mixed. It‚Äôs rare to find a place that takes the extra step to blend the century egg evenly into the porridge, rather than just adding them on top. Each spoonful is a blast of taste from the century egg!
review2:This stall is my all time favorite and serve the best porridge in the vicinity. Lots of ingredients with very nice texture. The garnishes also enhance the flavour. The taste is consistent throughout the years
review3:I try fish porridge that served by 2 elderlies,
no waiting time since not much queue - very efficient!

1 portion is $4, still normal price if compare to other places. The sliced fish were very small and they give addition of ginger. I like!
Would love to come back anytime soon ü§ç
review4:Value for money porridge. Very thick porridge, with plenty of flavour and texture. Add the egg - it gives the porridge added weight and character. They also put lots of condiments.

Very good and I highly recommend it. The queue during lunch can be very long, but the wait is definitely worth it!
