review1:Chicken was tender compared to the other chicken rice stall at this food centre. The gravy over the chicken really caught my eye. I can’t say I hated it but definitely not liking it.
Only one dipping sauce was provided and no soup either. I wonder if that’s the traditional way to serve HCR in Singapore. 🤔

Is it worth coming all the way? No. Only if you are close by and crave for affordable chicken rice. 😏
I’m sure there are plenty of nice chicken rice places with a better setting, more hygienic and comfortable environment to enjoy the food. 😌

review2:The line wasn't as long when we visited on a Monday morning. The wait was about 5 minutes. It's very organized now with a window for ordering and payment and the next window for picking up your food while you remain in the queue. Food was still as good as I remembered almost a decade ago, although the portion is definitely smaller now. The rice was good! It's different from Chinese and Japanese rice, and also from jasmine rice. We shared a size medium and were very happy we came here and did the "tourist" thing.

review3:If you're in Singapore and want to try a true local classic, Tian Tian at the hawker centre is a must. I ordered the most basic dish — just the chicken and rice — and it was everything I hoped for. The chicken was tender, boneless, and full of flavor, and the rice was so fragrant it could stand on its own.

One thing I didn’t know: you need to ask for their sauces separately — they don’t automatically include them, and they’re a key part of the experience. Even without them, it was still delicious, but I’ll definitely do it right next time.

Also, a quick tip for first-timers: there are two sections at the front. The first is where you place your order and pay (cashier area). Then, take your receipt or ticket to the second section on the left and hand it to the ladies there to collect your food. I missed that step at first, and a few people ended up cutting in front of me just because they knew the process. The staff doesn’t speak much English, so it can be a little confusing if it’s your first time.

All in all, it was well worth the 10–15 minute wait. I’ll be dreaming about that plate of chicken rice until I return.

review4: Unfortunately, I found this place to be completely overrated. The queue was long, though to their credit, service was fast once you get in.

However, the food was disappointing—served cold, and in some cases, the chicken wasn’t fully cooked. Most of the dishes seemed to rely on the same sauce, which made everything taste quite similar. If you still want to try it, stick to the chicken rice, but even then, you can easily find better versions elsewhere in Singapore.

Overall, it didn’t live up to the hype, and I won’t be returning.
