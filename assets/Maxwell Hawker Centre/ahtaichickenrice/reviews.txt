review1:Each grain of rice has a life of its own. The rice is generously coated in chicken oil that gives it a beautiful off white hue and I could taste each grain bouncing in my mouth. Chicken is smooth and silky. Not a fan of chicken skin usually but I subconsciously devoured everything.

No issues with the disposable plates. In fact, any local knows this is much more hygienic than the reusable plastic ones, where most cleaners who are paid peanuts at hawkers donâ€™t do a serious job with cleaning. So understand the local context and get off your high horses.
review2:Best Hainanese Chicken Rice!

We did some research before reached to this place and tried SG'chicken rice, then figured out even there is no Michellin star for this place - this is actually superb with reasonable price.
The chicken is soft, tender goes with fresh, delicious vegie and amazing chicken rice. You should order the set meal (S$6 or 8 for bigger serve)
It locates in the middle of the first lane of Maxwell food court, you wont miss it 'cause of the long quene!
review3:Not as famous as Tin Tin but this shop delivers higher value, as they produce very delicious Singaporean chicken rice at a more reasonable price than Tin Tin. This shop has long queue so be patient.
