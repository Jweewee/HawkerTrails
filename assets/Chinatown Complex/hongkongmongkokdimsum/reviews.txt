review1:The stall been for for a long time yet this was my first visit and it tasted great!!

You need to take the queue number first, order then is your call. You can cut the queue without ordering the signature Barbecued Pork Bun (叉燒包).
review2:Char Siew Bao were amazing. They ask if you want to eat there or takeaway which is handy.

Take a number and you only order when your number is called. You collect the food when you order as they have the food in steamers already
review3:It can get busy here snd the ticket system can be quite confusing. The dim sum were of good quality. I particularly enjoyed the char siew pao. The cheong fan was also delicious. Thin slivers of rice noodle steamed just right. It’s a food court experience snd its popularity means that it requires patience. Get there at opening time.
