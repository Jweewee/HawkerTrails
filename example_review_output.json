Standard has dropped. And the stall lady (cashier) was very arrogant!!!!\nSeller said wait 45mins, I gave them benefit of doubt. After waited 45 mins,  and given them a few reminders, they finally delivered after more than an hour. Will write off this stall and never go back again!!!!!","review_date":"2025-07-15T13:00:17.515Z","number_of_likes":0,"response_of_owner":null,"response_date":null,"photos":null,"review_details":[{"title":"Food","value":"1"},{"title":"Service","value":"1"},{"title":"Atmosphere","value":"3"}],"profile_pic_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWBHj4mwlQ07vhlXVzSn2fvbS3_IvlvS6WtEYpbXFd5gTADhxLM=s120-c-rp-mo-br100","place_general_rating":3.9,"overall_place_riviews":870,"questions_answers":[{"question":"Sorry thot they renovating the wet mkt.
